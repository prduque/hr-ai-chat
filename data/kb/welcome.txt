ACME
Brief description of the company and operation
ACME is a Portuguese tour operator, specialized in organizing tailor-made self-drive itineraries in Portugal and Spain. Since 2009, we have been offering a unique and comprehensive set of exclusive services and materials, provided in a turnkey package, aimed at those who wish to visit our country in an independent, safe, enriching, and comfortable way.
ACME was born in 2009 in Portugal, and Spain Trails naturally emerged with requests from clients who wanted to extend their trips to the neighboring country. In 2017, a dedicated brand and website for Spain was launched. In 2023, with the launch of Italy as a destination, Portugal Trails and Spain Trails became ACME, a single brand with three exciting destinations, while maintaining the same values and concept.
The operation is managed from our offices in Portugal and relies on strategic partners in Portugal, Spain, and Italy, who ensure the delivery of services and customer support during the trip.
Who is the ACME client?
The ACME client comes mostly from the United States and Canada, is over 55 years old, has already traveled to several countries, and seeks consultancy and local knowledge, quality, convenience, and safety.
The client values personalization, quick responses, empathetic relationships, and the feeling that their consultant is going the “extra mile” to ensure an excellent experience.
Although they may say they would like to visit “off the beaten path” locations, in reality, they want to see the highlights and towns/villages such as Pinhão, Marvão, and Évora, which are already “off” enough.
ACME’s communication and documentation are quite complete but dense; clients rarely manage to read everything in full, and therefore, we must ensure they know exactly what they are booking, in order to avoid complaints during the trip.
While traveling, the client is demanding and values the quick resolution of any incident that may arise.
The client also values reimbursement for experiences not carried out as expected, or compensation by offering another experience (dinner, tour, etc.).
